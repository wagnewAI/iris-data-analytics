## Insights:
Petal measurements (length and width) show greater variation and tend to better differentiate species compared to sepal measurements.

Setosa tends to have smaller petal measurements compared to Versicolor and Virginica, which have more overlapping ranges.

Versicolor and Virginica have larger petals but differ in some characteristics (like petal width).
and 
1. Setosa is perfectly predicted.
2. Versicolor and virginica are predicted well, but not perfectly.
3. The overall model is strong, with 93% accuracy and balanced performance across metrices.
